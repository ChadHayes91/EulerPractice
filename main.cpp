//The prime factors of 13195 are 5, 7, 13 and 29.
//What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

//This solution can easily be solved by having a for loop that first tests if each number is a factor of 600851475143 and then testing if that factor is prime.
//Solving the problem this way would take far too long, likely taking hours to compute.
//I've solved this problem by cutting out the majority of the for loop since we only need to test to the square root of each number.
//For example, if I listed the factors of 100, they would be: 1 and 100, 2 and 50, 4 and 25, 5 and 20, 10 and 10, 20 and 5, 25 and 4, 50 and 2, 100 and 1.
//You can notice a pattern here, that up to the square root of the number your testing (the square root of 100 is 10), you've gone through every factor once.
//My method below starts with an empty array, and then adds two elements - a factor and its compliment. We can test if each of those elements are prime by using a for loop only to the square root of that number.
