# EulerPractice

This is the solution to #10 at projecteuler.net.

Note that I solve this problem using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. Creating a function that tests for primality would take far too long to calculate. Details on the sieve of Eratosthenes can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes

The problem is:

The sum of the primes below 10 is 2 + 3 + 5 + 7 = 17.

Find the sum of all the primes below two million.
