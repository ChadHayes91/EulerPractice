# EulerPractice

This is problem #2 on projecteuler.net- finding the sum of the even numbers in the Fibonacci sequence that do not exceed 4 million. I tried to find a more optimal solution which required a math proof using induction.

The problem is:

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
