# EulerPractice

The intent of this repository is to develop programming experience by solving difficult mathematical problems. The problems get increasingly more difficult. I've provided solution to each problem using C++ and Python.

NOTE THAT EACH PROBLEM AND SOLUTION IS ON A DIFFERENT BRANCH OF THIS REPOSITORY!

All problems are from: https://projecteuler.net/archives


**Problem 1:

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
